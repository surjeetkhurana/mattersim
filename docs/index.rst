Welcome to the MatterSim Documentation!
=======================================

Overview
--------

`MatterSim <https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04967>`_ is an advanced deep learning model designed to simulate
the properties of materials across a wide range of elements, temperatures, and pressures.
The model leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to deliver high accuracy and
efficiency in atomistic simulations, making it a valuable tool for researchers
in the field of materials science.

MatterSim is still in active development, and newer models may be released
in appropriate time. Please stay tuned for updates.

Pre-trained Models
------------------

We currently offer two pre-trained **MatterSim-v1** models based on the **M3GNet** architecture

1. **MatterSim-v1.0.0-1M**: A mini version of the model that is faster to run.
2. **MatterSim-v1.0.0-5M**: A larger version of the model that is more accurate.

These models have been trained using the data generated through the workflows
introduced in the `MatterSim <https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04967>`_ manuscript, which provides an in-depth
explanation of the methodologies underlying the MatterSim model.
